1. How the script handles arguments and options
It uses getopts to handle -n and -v flags robustly, supporting combinations like -vn.

Positional arguments after options are treated as the search string and filename.

Basic validation checks ensure correct usage and existence of the input file.

2. Adding -i, -c, or regex support
-i is already included via grep -i.

-c (count) or -l (list filenames) would require additional flags and logic (e.g., count_only=true).

For regex, the structure wouldn't need major changes, as grep supports regex by defaultâ€”just ensure the search string isn't quoted.

3. Hardest part to implement
Option parsing was the trickiestâ€”especially managing positional arguments after flags (getopts doesnâ€™t handle this directly).

Also ensuring the correct behavior with combined flags and helpful error messages took time to test and fine-tune.
